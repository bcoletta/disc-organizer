This is a script for finding the best way to organize groups of discs into a binder

# Instructions
1. Update the `groups.json` file to have a list of groups, in my case I used franchises, with their name and the number of discs in that group.
2. Update the PAGE_SIZE variable to match the number of discs per page in your binder.
3. Run `node index.js`
